The creators of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) describe it as "*a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve*".

This repository contains my answers to some problems presented within the project. My code is in no way supposed to be the most optimal. I try to work on the problems on my own, sometime I look for inspiration / approaches online if I really get stuck, but most often I prefer to tinker / play around with the problem, until I get to an answer that works for me. If my answer is too slow I will try to optimise it a bit, but I'm not trying to get the best performance; after all, I'm just doing this for fun.

Feel free to have a look, or blatantly steal anything you find here.
