## My little repository of solutions from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problem repository

From time to time I like to work on math problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).
I'm mostly doing this for fun, I'm not looking for the fastest, most efficient code.


## INSTRUCTIONS

execute these commands from within this directory:
```
source ./setup.sh
python3 all_solutions.py
```
